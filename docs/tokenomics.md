# SHIB GPT Tokenomics

## Token Overview

The SHIB GPT token operates on the Ethereum network and adheres to the ERC-20 standard. It boasts a total supply of 336,696,966 tokens, with the distribution as follows:

- **80% Uniswap:** Approximately 269,357,573 tokens are allocated to Uniswap to ensure liquidity and facilitate trading activities.

- **10% Marketing:** A portion of tokens, equivalent to 33,669,696, is designated for marketing initiatives aimed at promoting the token and expanding its adoption.

- **5% Partners:** Strategic partners contributing to the project ecosystem are entitled to 16,834,848 tokens, comprising 5% of the total supply.

- **5% Team:** An identical amount of 16,834,848 tokens is reserved for the development team as an incentive for their ongoing dedication and contributions to the project's success.

## Token Lock-ups

- **Liquidity Pool Lock-up:** 20% of the total token supply allocated to Uniswap will be locked up for a period of 1 month to ensure stability and prevent sudden fluctuations in liquidity.

- **Remaining Tokens Lock-up:** The remaining 20% of tokens will be subject to a lock-up period of 3 months after launch, during which they cannot be traded or accessed. These tokens will be earmarked for future use and distribution.

## Decentralization

Following the token launch, a smart contract renunciation will occur within 72 hours, transitioning the governance of the SHIB GPT token to a fully decentralized model. This relinquishment of control underscores our commitment to decentralization and community-driven governance principles.
